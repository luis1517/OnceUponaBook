                <h3>A Path Begins (The Thickety, #1)</h3>
                <p>It was a joy to read this book. I came across the series when I was at the library. This first book itÂ´s a great story full of other stories along the way, great to read regardless of your age and easy to read too. I always liked books that talk about magic and J.A. White was brilliant to bring old spooky stories with a twist of hard truths into a novel.</p>

                <h3>Well of Witches (The Thickety, #3)</h3>
                <p>Very nice book full of values and topics one can reflect on. In this 3th book Kara realizes that's she is more than enough and that her flaw is self-doubt since she has all the potential but she often forgets one thing- believing in herself.</p>
